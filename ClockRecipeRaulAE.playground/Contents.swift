import UIKit

// Ingredients (variables used)
var second = 0
var minute = 0
var hour = 0

// Loops that counts up seconds

// 1. have a loop that increases the second variable by += 1 every time the value is checked
//  1a. I Will do this by having a while loop increase the value of the second variable while it is below 60
//  1b. When the second variable reaches 60 I will set the second variable to 0 and the minute variable to += 1
// 2. if second reaches 60 the second variabel is reset to zero and the minute variable is increased by 1
//  2a. I will do this by setting up a while statement to check if the minute variable is below 60
//  2b. When the minute variable reaches 60 I will set the minute variable variable to 0 and the hour variable to += 1
// 3. The minute variable reaches 60 it will be reset and the hour variable will increase by 1
//  3a. The hour variable will only keep count of the passing time
